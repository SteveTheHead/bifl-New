# User Authentication Fixes - Summary

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. ⚠️ CRITICAL: Authentication System Mismatch
**Problem:** Your login page was using **Better Auth** but your dashboard was checking for **Supabase auth sessions**. These are two completely different authentication systems, which is why login appeared to work but the dashboard didn't recognize you.

**Fix:**
- Updated `/api/user/auth/route.ts` to use Better Auth sessions exclusively
- Now the entire app uses one consistent auth system (Better Auth)

### 2. Email Template Not Rendering
**Problem:** You received plain text emails instead of the designed HTML template.

**Fix:**
- Added plain text fallback (`text` parameter) for email clients that don't support HTML
- Email now includes both HTML (for modern clients) and plain text (for fallback)

### 3. Email Domain Issue
**Problem:** `send.buyitforlifeproducts.com` is not verified in Resend

**Current Status:**
- Using `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's verified test domain) temporarily
- This works but shows "onboarding@resend.dev" as sender
- You MUST verify your custom domain to use `hello@send.buyitforlifeproducts.com`

## Files Changed

1. **lib/auth.ts**
   - Added `baseURL` configuration for correct verification URLs
   - Added plain text email fallback
   - Using verified test domain temporarily

2. **app/api/user/auth/route.ts**
   - Complete rewrite to use Better Auth instead of Supabase
   - Now properly checks Better Auth sessions
   - Returns user data in expected format for dashboard

## Testing Instructions

### Test User Login (Production)

1. Go to https://www.buyitforlifeproducts.com/auth/signin
2. Login with your verified account: `stephenlewisroberts82@gmail.com`
3. You should be redirected to `/user-dashboard`
4. Dashboard should show your email and load properly
5. **If it works, the fix is successful!**

### Test New User Signup (Optional)

1. Go to https://www.buyitforlifeproducts.com/auth/signup
2. Sign up with a new test email
3. Check your inbox for verification email
4. Email should be HTML formatted (not plain text)
5. Click verification link - should redirect properly (not 404)
6. After verification, login should work
7. Dashboard should load and recognize you

## Next Steps

### REQUIRED: Verify Your Custom Email Domain

To use `hello@send.buyitforlifeproducts.com` instead of `onboarding@resend.dev`:

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Find `send.buyitforlifeproducts.com` in your domains list
3. Click on it to see DNS records
4. Add these DNS records to your domain registrar:
   - **SPF Record** (TXT)
   - **DKIM Record** (TXT)
   - **DMARC Record** (TXT)
5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
6. Once verified, I'll update `lib/auth.ts` line 51 to use your custom domain

### Future Enhancements

- Admin sign out button
- Admin user management page
- Password reset flow for users
- User email change functionality

5. Take screenshots of any errors and send them to me
