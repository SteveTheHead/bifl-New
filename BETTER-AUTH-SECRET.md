# Better Auth Secret Generated

## Your Generated Secret

```
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=0gzcQwugN6dIZ+zWC0NdGz7zbNsx3OeVz/O4ekUgfXA=
```

## How to Use

### Local Development (.env.local)

1. Open your `.env.local` file
2. Add the line above
3. Save and restart your development server

### Production (Vercel)

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables
2. Add new variable:
   - **Name:** `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
   - **Value:** `0gzcQwugN6dIZ+zWC0NdGz7zbNsx3OeVz/O4ekUgfXA=`
   - **Environment:** Production (and optionally Preview)
3. Click "Save"
4. Redeploy your application

## What This Enables

With `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` configured, the following features become active:

- ✅ User authentication and session management
- ✅ Google OAuth sign-in (requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- ✅ Secure session cookies
- ✅ User profile management
- ✅ Protected routes and API endpoints

## Security Notes

- **Keep this secret confidential** - never commit it to Git
- **Use different secrets** for development and production
- **Rotate regularly** - generate a new secret periodically for security
- To generate a new secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`

## Additional Setup (Optional)

For full authentication functionality, you may also want to configure:

### Google OAuth
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret
```

Get these from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

### Polar (for subscriptions)
```
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-polar-access-token
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-polar-webhook-secret
```

Get these from: https://polar.sh/settings

**Delete this file after copying the secret to your environment variables** to avoid accidentally committing it.
