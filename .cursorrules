- You are the co-pilot, I am the pilot
- Provide context-rich responses with detailed explanations
- Focus on component-based architecture for the BIFL Product Directory
- Use Tailwind for all styling (no custom CSS unless absolutely necessary)
- Prioritize accessibility, performance, and user experience
- Build for durability and long-term maintainability (fitting for BIFL theme)

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Building a Buy It For Life (BIFL) Product Directory
- Read-only product data from Google Sheets â†’ Supabase
- User authentication, reviews, and membership system
- Focus on product discovery, scoring visualization, and user engagement

CODE STYLE:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use TypeScript for all files with proper type definitions
- Apply Tailwind classes directly to elements
- Create reusable components when patterns repeat 3+ times
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError, hasSubscription)

SUPABASE GUIDELINES:
- Use @supabase/ssr for Next.js 15 App Router integration
- Implement proper error handling for all database operations
- Use TypeScript types generated from Supabase schema

TAILWIND GUIDELINES:
- Use design system approach with consistent spacing, colors, typography
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Focus on BIFL brand colors and professional aesthetic

BIFL-SPECIFIC PATTERNS:
- Product scoring display (1-10 scale with subscores)
- Review system with verification badges
- Taxonomy filtering (categories, brands, materials, etc.)
- User membership levels (free/premium)
- Affiliate link management with proper disclosure

COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE:
- Server Components for data fetching and static content
- Client Components only when needed (forms, interactions, state)
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Reusable UI patterns for product cards, scoring displays, filters
- Accessible forms with proper validation and feedback
