Amazon.com          KitchenAid's Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child's play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. This model also includes a pouring shield for guiding ingredients to their proper destination, and the bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman's bowling ball, this stand mixer isn't the sort of appliance you'll wipe down and put away. Better to find a square foot of free counter space for easy access; besides, this machine is as pretty as it is rugged--you'll want to show it off. --Betsy DanheimFrom the Manufacturer The Artisan mixer's strong 325-watt motor delivers the power to handle the heaviest mixtures, and mix large batches easily. The 5-quart polished stainless steel bowl with ergonomic handle is big enough to handle large batches of heavy mixtures. Its ergonomically designed handle is contoured to fit the hand and makes lifting the bowl more comfortable. Unique Mixing ActionThe beater spins clockwise as the shaft spins counter clockwise; moving the beater to 67 different points around the bowl. This unique mixing action creates a thorough blend of ingredients and eliminates the need to rotate the bowl. Multiple Speeds 10 speeds allow the user to select the right speed for the mixing job; from very high to very slow stir. It's easy to select the precise speed needed for a perfect mix. Versatile Accessories The flat beater, dough hook, and the professional wire whip add to the versatility of the mixer. The flat beater is the ideal accessory for mixing normal to heavy batters. From cake mixes to firm cookie dough, the flat beater mixes quickly and thoroughly.  The dough hook mixes and kneads yeast dough, saving both time and the effort of hand-kneading. The wire whip incorporates the maximum amount of air in whipped mixtures for fluffier whipped cream and angel food cakes.All attachments are solidly constructed, and attach easily to the stand mixer. Easy Clean Up The pouring shield fits around the top of the bowl and prevents ingredient splash-out. The chute makes it convenient and easy to add ingredients.  The tilt-back mixer head allows for easy access to bowl and beaters. A lock lever holds the mixer head securely in place and the bowl fastens tightly to the base.  Optional Attachments Optional attachments (sold separately) complete the package to make cooking a pleasure. From citrus juicer to sausage stuffer, KitchenAid stand mixers can handle just about any job in the kitchen.

Easily make your favorite cakes and multiple batches of cookie dough with the 5-quart stainless steel mixing bowl with comfortable handle. With 10 speeds, the standmixer will quickly become your kitchen’s culinary center as you mix, knead and whip ingredients with ease. And for even more versatility, the power hub fits optional attachments from food grinders to pasta makers and more.             Amazon.com          KitchenAid's Artisan stand mixer is a substantial piece of equipment: 325 watts of mixing power make child's play of creaming butter, kneading dough, and whipping cream. The kid in you will appreciate how quick and easy it is to mix up a batch of cookie dough. This model comes with three attachments: a flat beater for making batter, meat loaf, and all textures in-between; a wire whip for egg whites, mayonnaise, and more air-infused creations; and a hook for mixing and kneading yeast doughs. All three are solidly constructed and easily secured to the beater shaft with a simple twist. This model also includes a pouring shield for guiding ingredients to their proper destination, and the bowl itself locks tight to the base. Standing about 15 inches high, jutting out a foot, and weighing more than a grown woman's bowling ball, this stand mixer isn't the sort of appliance you'll wipe down and put away. Better to find a square foot of free counter space for easy access; besides, this machine is as pretty as it is rugged--you'll want to show it off. --Betsy DanheimFrom the Manufacturer The Artisan mixer's strong 325-watt motor delivers the power to handle the heaviest mixtures, and mix large batches easily. The 5-quart polished stainless steel bowl with ergonomic handle is big enough to handle large batches of heavy mixtures. Its ergonomically designed handle is contoured to fit the hand and makes lifting the bowl more comfortable. Unique Mixing ActionThe beater spins clockwise as the shaft spins counter clockwise; moving the beater to 67 different points around the bowl. This unique mixing action creates a thorough blend of ingredients and eliminates the need to rotate the bowl. Multiple Speeds 10 speeds allow the user to select the right speed for the mixing job; from very high to very slow stir. It's easy to select the precise speed needed for a perfect mix. Versatile Accessories The flat beater, dough hook, and the professional wire whip add to the versatility of the mixer. The flat beater is the ideal accessory for mixing normal to heavy batters. From cake mixes to firm cookie dough, the flat beater mixes quickly and thoroughly.  The dough hook mixes and kneads yeast dough, saving both time and the effort of hand-kneading. The wire whip incorporates the maximum amount of air in whipped mixtures for fluffier whipped cream and angel food cakes.All attachments are solidly constructed, and attach easily to the stand mixer. Easy Clean Up The pouring shield fits around the top of the bowl and prevents ingredient splash-out. The chute makes it convenient and easy to add ingredients.  The tilt-back mixer head allows for easy access to bowl and beaters. A lock lever holds the mixer head securely in place and the bowl fastens tightly to the base.  Optional Attachments Optional attachments (sold separately) complete the package to make cooking a pleasure. From citrus juicer to sausage stuffer, KitchenAid stand mixers can handle just about any job in the kitchen.

Sixteen different settings--four each in the four categories of extra fine, fine, regular, and coarse--let you adjust the grind to the specific blend of coffee and method of brewing. The finest setting is ideal for preparing Turkish coffee, which is a rare feature to find in a grinder.

The Infinity has an advanced conical burr design made of steel that is usually only found on commercial grinders. This burr design slows down the gears and reduces the amount of friction and heat to preserve coffee's flavor and aroma. The coffee container holds up to 4 ounces of grounds and remains sealed during grinding. For safety, the bean container also needs to be locked into place for the Infinity to operate. For easy cleaning, the bean container and upper burr lift off so you can clean the grinding chamber with the included brush and wipe down the exterior housing. The conical burr grinder measures 7-2/3 by 5-2/5 by 10-4/5 inches and carries a one-year limited warranty. --Cristina Vaamonde",,"5""L x 7.75""W x 10.5""H",,"PRECISION GRINDING: Commercial-grade, solid steel conical burrs with advanced cutting design",WIDE GRINDING RANGE: From ultrafine Turkish to French Press coarse and everything in between,PRESERVES AROMA: Gear reduction motor grinds slow with reduced noise and little static build-up,LARGE CAPACITY: 8.8 ounce bean container and 4 ounce ground coffee container,EASY TO CLEAN: Removable upper burr allows access for easy cleaning,7.5,"<p>Multiple owners report this grinder running strong after 5-10 years of daily use, though static issues and lack of replacement parts prevent a higher score.</p><ul><li><strong>Proven longevity:</strong> Users say it still works like new after 5+ years, with one owner using theirs since 2015 with regular use</li><li><strong>Solid construction:</strong> Reviewers describe it as well built and sturdy with a geared-down motor that reduces heat and extends component life</li><li><strong>Major red flag:</strong> No replacement parts available despite being marketed as a quality product, which limits its true BIFL potential</li><li><strong>Static and mess:</strong> Persistent static cling makes grounds jump out of the container, creating daily cleanup hassles that worsen in dry weather</li></ul><br><p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> A solid daily driver that'll last 5-10 years with care, but the lack of replacement parts means it's more buy-it-for-a-decade than buy-it-for-life.</p>",5.0,"<p>The Capresso Infinity shows mixed repair potential.

Now lodge has added a new line of seasoned steel skillets. This handy 10-inch seasoned steel skillet is the only pre-seasoned and ready to use out of the box steel pan in the market place right now. Each skillet is pre-seasoned with natural soy bean oil. Maintains very low and very high temperatures, making the pan a highly effective and versatile cooking piece. It performs well in residential and professional kitchens as well as outdoors. Made of 12 gauge carbon steel. Steel is a high density metal that does not retain odors. If maintained correctly, it will last a lifetime. Thickness of the cooking surface allows the pan to heat up quickly but also retain the heat needed for even cooking. The handle angle is conducive for both stove top and oven cooking. Each handle is attached to the skillet with 3 secure rivets. As a result of the pre-seasoning process, you may see a blister or bubble of oil at the southern-most point or at the end of the handle of the cookware piece. The cookware is hanging as it rides through the electrostatic sprayer and commercial conveyer ovens at very high temperatures. This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the cookware which creates an easy release finish. If visible, it will rub or flake off with your finger, leaving a brown spot. Don’t worry, it’s not rust but a seasoned spot that is brown, indicative of the varnish stage of seasoning. The brown spot will turn black with use. Made in the USA.

Proudly made in the USA, this skillet is perfect for generations of cooking.","Product Description          What makes this the classic American skillet? Made in the USA for more than 125 years, it's been a staple in kitchens around the world. Crafted in America with iron and oil, its naturally seasoned cooking surface is ready to help you turn your meals into delicious, shareable moments. Cast to last! Seasoned and ready to use. Hailed as an essential kitchen tool by the country's leading chefs and publications, the Lodge 10.25 Inch Cast Iron Skillet has been crafted to cook memorable meals for generations. It offers an abundance of possibilities. Care instructions for cast iron: 1. Wash with warm water. Add a mild soap, if desired. 2. Dry thoroughly with a lint-free cloth or paper towel. 3. Oil the surface of the pan with a very light layer of cooking oil while warm. Hang or store the cookware in a dry place.             Amazon.com          The American-based company Lodge has been fine-tuning its construction of rugged, cast-iron cookware for more than a century. No other metal is as long-lasting and works as well for spreading and retaining heat evenly during cooking. Lodge's Logic line of cookware comes factory pre-seasoned with the company's vegetable oil formula, and is ready to use right out of the box. After cooking, simply scrub the cast iron with a stiff brush and hot water, no soap, and dry immediately.  Breakfast in particular somehow tastes extra hearty when cooked in a heavy cast-iron skillet. Cast iron loves a campfire, a stovetop, or an oven, and can slow-cook foods without scorching and sear meat at higher temperatures. A good all-purpose size at 10-1/4 inches in diameter and 2 inches deep, this skillet can fry up eggs, pancakes, steaks, chicken, hamburgers, and can bake desserts and casseroles as well. A helper handle aids in lifting, and the looped primary handle allows hanging. Two side spouts pour off grease or juice. Even though the pan comes pre-seasoned, applying a little vegetable oil before use helps prevent food from sticking. Whether used in a kitchen or camp, this virtually indestructible pan should last for generations and is covered by a lifetime warranty. --Ann Bieri

Zippo produced a steel case lighter and inside unit. Because the drawn steel cases had an uneven, unsightly finish, they were coated with a thick black material that baked to a crackled finish. Today, we apply a Black Wrinkle finish using a specially formulated powder coating process. Each lighter has a bottom stamp signifying the year it was made, is refillable, and is backed by Zippo's famous lifetime guarantee.

It features extra-wide 28 mm slots to accommodate a sandwich cage. ProHeat elements increase toasting efficiency and element longevity. The toaster has a removable crumb tray and an adjustable rear foot. Manually operated, the Dualit toaster features a dial to control the degree of browning. This allows you to enjoy your toast exactly the way you like it. An ejector system means that the toast does not pop up but stays warm until the ejector lever is pushed up. It can be set to toast however many slices you wish and has a handy bagel function to toast one side whilst warming the other. Each of these toasters is assembled by hand and the assembler's individual mark can be found on the base plate.             Amazon.com          Engineered in England and hand-assembled to the last detail, the Dualit 4-slice toaster is that ideal accomplishment--a hardworking kitchen appliance with an elegant presence. Its curvy retro shape is undeniably handsome and its structural components withstand the rigors of a high-octane kitchen. In fact, the toaster can output up to 130 slices per hour, should the entire neighborhood ever depend on you for breakfast or tea.  The key to Dualit's exceptionally even browning is the toaster's system of patented ProHeat elements, a series of flat bars behind a smooth, transparent coating. The result is an efficient, durable design, suitable for everything from brioche to sandwiches. The elements are encased by a rugged, stainless-steel housing that you may not even recognize as a relative of its lightweight, plasticky peers. Each slot measures 28 mm wide and is extra deep to allow for the use of the Dualit sandwich cage (sold separately). One adjustable leg accommodates uneven surfaces and rubberized feet protect your countertop.  The Dualit toaster has manually operated functions and is designed for people who like to engage with their appliances. Operation is simple but rewarding. A rocker switch selects 2- or 4-slice toasting, and a 4-minute timer knob lets you fine-tune browning time. Instead of a pop-up function that can prematurely cool toast, the unit comes with an ejector knob that you raise when you're ready for it. For smaller households or busy kitchens, Dualit also makes 2- and 3-slice models. All Dualit toasters come with a one-year warranty. --Emily Bedard",Metal,"8.2""D x 14.1""W x 8.6""H",,ProHeat system evenly browns bread,Insulated stainless steel body;High lift mechanism to remove small items easily,Removable crumb tray; adjustable rear foot; Switch-system controls the degree of browning,Insulated stainless steel body,,8.0,"<p>This tank of a toaster splits the community hard — those who get it working swear it'll outlast their grandkids, while others rage about uneven toast and narrow slots.</p><ul><li><strong>Built to last forever:</strong> Users report 12-23 years of daily use with minimal issues.

The 9564CV is powered by a 12 AMP motor with soft start for smoother start-ups. The five-stage variable speed dial (2,800 - 10,500 RPM) allows the user to match the RPM to the application. The electronic limiter stops the motor and reduces accidental motor overload and burnout, and the electronic speed control maintains consistent speed under load. Labyrinth construction protects the motor with a complex set of channels, prohibiting dust and contamination. In addition, the protective zig-zag varnish seals the motor and bearings from dust and debris by creating a barrier under rotation. The 9564CV is engineered with SJS, an innovation from Makita that protects the gears by automatically disengaging the motor should the grinding wheel accidentally catch or bind.Comfort and Ergonomics
The 9564CV is built with comfort and ergonomic features for extended use. The grinder weighs just 4 pounds with a lock-on switch for easy operation. In addition, the side handle can be easily installed on either side of the tool, and the ""tool-less"" wheel guard adjustment provides easy clamping.Variable Speed for Stone Work
The 9564CV is a versatile and powerful grinder with variable speed, allowing the user to set the RPM to the material. The variable speed control feature makes the 9564CV ideal for stone work, including polishing and grinding. The 9564CV is just another example of Makita's commitment to innovative technology and best-in-class engineering.About Makita's Super Joint System (SJS)
Super Joint System (SJS) is an innovation from Makita engineering where the motor armature and spiral bevel gear are linked by a coil spring. If the grinding wheel catches or binds, the coil spring relaxes and disengages the gears from the motor. As the grinding wheel stops, the gears and motor are protected. Makita's growing line of SJS-equipped grinders includes models ranging from a 1/4"" die grinder to a 7-inch angle grinder.About Makita

Amazon.com          About Coleman More than 100 years ago, a young man with an entrepreneurial spirit and a better idea began manufacturing lanterns in Wichita, Kansas. His name was W.C. Coleman, and the company he founded would change life in America. A man plagued with such poor vision he sometimes had to ask classmates to read aloud to him, Coleman saw a brilliant light in 1900 in a drugstore window that stopped him in his tracks. He inquired about the light inside and discovered he was able to read even the small print on a medicine bottle by the illumination. The lamps had mantles, not wicks, and were fueled by gasoline under pressure instead of coal oil. Soon afterward, Coleman started a lighting service that offered a ""no light, no pay"" clause--a big step forward for merchants who were burned by inferior products that rarely worked--and drew substantial interest from businesses that wanted to keep their lights on after dark. In the ensuing years, Coleman expanded its product line well beyond lanterns. The company's current catalog is thick with products that make spending time outdoors a pleasure. There are coolers that keep food and drinks cold for days on end, comfortable airbeds that won't deflate during the night, a complete line of LED lights that last for years, powerful portable grills that cook with an authentic open-grill flame, and much, much more. Coleman has truly fashioned much of our outdoor camping experience, and expects to do so for generations to come.",Blend,"13.7""L x 4.1""W x 21.9""H",,"Cooking power: Up to 20,000 total BTUs.

Our ultra-dense cushioning helps protect your joints and provides extra comfort. A favorite amongst yogis, Pilates aficionados, and fitness gurus. Closed-cell technology blocks dirt and moisture from sweat. We recommend pairing with one of our performance towels to increase grip in sweaty sessions.                  Amazon.com               The legendary Black Mat PRO (formerly known as the Black Mat) is celebrating 12 years as one of the world's finest yoga mat. There's a reason the Black Mat PRO inspires such passion in its users; with its denser, thicker form, unparalleled comfort and cushioning, superior non-slip fabric-like finish, and simple, elegant design, the Black Mat PRO will revolutionize your practice. And best of all, it now comes with a Lifetime Guarantee. The Manduka Black Mat PRO is chosen first by yoga teachers throughout the world, and by yogis of every experience level who value not only their individual practice but also their surrounding world.  

 The proprietary dot-pattern bottom on the bottom of the BlackMatPRO resists sliding and is engineered for long-lasting use with high quality materials that won't peel, flake, or fade. The fabric-like surface finish offers superior slip-resistance, even with light perspiration. This longevity and Manduka's Lifetime Guarantee reduces consumption and landfill waste by guarding against wear and tear. 
 Features & Specifications:Zero-waste in manufacturing; Oeko-Tex certified, emissions-free manufacturing Backed by a Lifetime Guarantee Superior wear and longevity Comfortably cushions spine, hips, knees, and elbows on hard floors Slip resistant, yet non-sticky, even when wet from light perspiration Provides stability on hard or soft surfaces Weight: 7 pounds Dimensions: 26 by 71 by 1/4 inches (W x L x D) To Clean:
 

 We recommend using Manduka Mat Renew or any non-solvent household cleaner and a damp cloth or sponge. Hang to dry in the sunshine. Do not put your mat in the washing machine- it may break the machine and ruin your mat. To Store:
 Roll your Black Mat PRO with the top side (fabric-finish) facing outwards. This keeps the corners of the mat flat when practicing. 
 To Break In:
 The surface texture of the Black Mat PRO improves with use. Our customers have found that the best way to break in their mat is to use it on a daily basis. Another trick is to sprinkle coarse sea salt over your mat, scrub it down with a sponge, and air dry in the sunshine. Manduka's Green Mission
 Manduka PRO series yoga mats, designed to last a lifetime (or two), curb the amount of PVC mats that enter landfills every year and reduces overall mat consumption. Also, during the manufacturing of most PVC products, toxic emissions may be released into the air. However, PRO series mats are manufactured through a process that ensures no toxic emissions are released into the atmosphere. The Black Mat PRO is certified safe for human contact by OEKO-TEX, an environmental certification agency in Europe for the textile industry.",Polyvinyl Chloride,,,Imported,"BEST IN CLASS MAT: Our PRO multipurpose workout mat is the #1 recommended mat by fitness instructors and yoga therapists all over the world, built to last a lifetime","HIGH DENSITY CUSHION: Ultra-dense, 6 mm cushioning provides superior support, stability, and joint protection, along with comfort on any surface","RESPONSIBLY MADE: Each mat is meticulously handmade in an emissions-free German facility with 100% latex-free PVC that has been certified STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX; Handmade products may vary slightly in length, width and/or thickness","BREAKING IN YOUR MAT: The non slip grip of the mat will improve with use, and textured top layer allows you to flow between postures without sticking; Keep practicing to break your mat in over time",,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,Germany,,,,,,,,,,8211,,,,

While some users discuss the rougher finish compared to vintage or boutique brands, the overwhelming social consensus is that Lodge offers unparalleled BIFL value, making it one of the most common and trusted BIFL recommendations.",9.5,"Lodge's cast iron skillet is BIFL royalty for good reason: it's an indestructible, multi-generational workhorse that costs less than most date nights.

                     Review          We've battled ferocious humanoid felines. We've incinerated countless stormtroopers. We've certainly stopped a number of ancient, seemingly omniscient species from invading our galaxy. But never before in a space sim have we fought the Western World's pesky 20th-century adversaries, those Sputnik-launching Ruskies. Yet in spite of the implausible premise that 160 years from now the Cold War will suddenly reignite in a conflict that will span our solar system, Digital Anvil's debut game is an enjoyable story-driven space combat sim that should meet, but not exceed, the lofty expectations of fans of the developers' previous games.  The reason that expectations for StarLancer are so high is, of course, because Digital Anvil was founded by a team of developers led by Chris Roberts, who had effectively launched the space-sim genre with the Wing Commander games. While Chris Roberts has been focusing on the development of the far more ambitious Freelancer, his brother Erin Roberts and UK developer Warthog have crafted StarLancer. Warthog and Erin Roberts had previously combined their efforts to produce Privateer 2: The Darkening. The influences of that game and the Wing Commander series are quickly evident in StarLancer, a very traditional space sim.  StarLancer has many of the same strengths and a few of the weaknesses of the previous products of the developers. While other space sims, such as the games in the X-Wing series and, more recently, the FreeSpace games, have made their star-hopping conflicts largely impersonal affairs, the Wing Commander games have focused far more on the experiences of individual pilots. Both approaches have advantages. By personalizing the conflicts, the Wing Commander games make you empathetic to the struggles of the protagonists. On the other hand, by maintaining a more distant perspective, FreeSpace 2 and similar games provide a more strategic view of the games' respective conflicts.  Interestingly, StarLancer straddles both of these approaches. StarLancer's compromise between these extremes works exceptionally well, as it conveys the significance of the epic battles in an intimate manner. You'll never get to know the personalities of your wingmen in StarLancer as well as Wing Commander players know the quirks of wingmates such as Maniac, but your fellow pilots are also not as faceless as they are in most other space sims. In StarLancer, there are dozens of personalities whom you'll eventually become acquainted with - from your wingmen peers to wartime politicians, StarLancer's characters collectively provide you with a range of perspectives from which to view the conflict. There are a number of particularly memorable characters, including a Red Baron-esque German ace and a traitorous fellow pilot - of course, you couldn't possibly have a game produced by the creator of the Wing Commander series without a traitor subplot.  While the premise of a 22nd-century war with the Russians seems ludicrous, and their Eastern Coalition's conduct consistently lives up to our lowest expectations in the campy manner of a Roger Moore Bond flick, its instant familiarity is actually a great strength of StarLancer. Instead of hearing of the exploits of another faceless squadron as in the FreeSpace games, you will instead be provided with insight into the exploits of readily identifiable groups of characters through StarLancer's war updates. It's easier to become empathetically and emotionally involved with the characters when you see recognizable modern imagery. It's an effective gimmick.  Unfortunately, the primary flaws of the developers' previous game, Privateer 2, have also been incorporated into StarLancer. StarLancer's flight model is quirky, and it doesn't convey the sensation of moving in 3D space as smoothly as in most recent space sims. The performance variances between the different flyable ships aren't as pronounced as you would expect, given the ships' respective ratings in various specifications. This perceived problem may have just been exacerbated by the inept artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled pilots - enemy ships fly straight at you and then begin turning, ineffectively trying to home in on your ship. When you're around large capital ships or other objects, the computer-controlled ships really display their incompetence as they constantly smash into fixtures or remain relatively motionless. Unless you doze off and consistently travel in the same direction for a prolonged span of time, your impotent computer opponents will be unable to dent your ship's shields and armor. Since Warthog seems to prefer equipping the fighters in its games with rapidly firing, devastating gunnery, dogfights in StarLancer tend to be pathetically one-sided affairs. Clint Eastwood never had it this easy in Firefox.  However, completing your mission goals isn't as simple as dispatching your foes, primarily because of StarLancer's limited heads-up display. Most missions devolve at some point into protecting a few friendly ships or smaller objects, but the HUD and interface make it extremely difficult to maintain contact with the ships or objects you are supposed to defend. There's no way to program the interface or set up the HUD to allow you to quickly target those friendlies to check their conditions or locations. In addition, rather than having you rely on the same, familiar 3D radar used in the Wing Commander games (or to adopt the even more intuitive system used by the X-Wing games), the developers felt it was appropriate to develop yet another form of 3D radar. Unfortunately, they've managed to concoct the least accessible system yet. Rather than being foiled by the magnificent flying or superior weaponry of your opponents, you'll usually find yourself failing mission goals because of inadequate situational awareness.  The interface and HUD aren't a significant step backward compared with those offered by the Wing Commander games, but they are inadequate given the additional complexity of StarLancer's missions. Simplistic mission design has always been a complaint justly hurled against the Wing Commander games, whereas StarLancer's complex missions are fantastic. Much of StarLancer's story is conveyed through events that occur within missions, and there is a tremendous amount of mission-specific dialogue. Each mission also contains several scripted events depicted from within the game engine. Independence War veterans will be familiar with this effective technique, which always ensures that you get the opportunity to see significant mission events from the best camera perspective. The technique works extremely well at convincingly conveying plot developments without abruptly removing you from the gaming world.  Mission goals are also well varied in StarLancer, and even though the game treats heavy bombers as capital ships, you'll still get plenty of opportunities to bomb large targets. While there aren't as many missions in StarLancer's campaign as there are in a typical space sim, StarLancer's missions are frequently lengthy, so the campaign doesn't feel short. The length of some of the missions also makes the lack of an option to save the game within missions a more notable omission. While no games in the genre have offered the opportunity to save a game within the heat of a battle, since there are usually several stages to each StarLancer mission, the opportunity to save after each stage (an option recently offered in Independence War Deluxe) would have been particularly useful. Still, one of StarLancer's best attributes is its mission design.  StarLancer's graphics and sound are also its strengths. While the musical score pales compared with the haunting tracks in the FreeSpace games, the epic Wing Commander scores of George Oldziey, or the familiar riffs of the Star Wars games, the sound effects in StarLancer are excellent. The ominous sound of a torpedo launch and the screech of a rocket launch are particularly distinctive. StarLancer's graphics are outstanding, and they make exceptionally good use of lighting effects. While ship design isn't inspired - most vehicles are blocky abstractions of each other - some of the fighters have moving components, and the textures are universally detailed. The explosions are convincing, and they create a ton of realistic debris, occasionally including the corpse of your hapless victim. Most capital ships are disappointingly small compared with the dreadnoughts that roamed space in Wing Commander Prophecy or FreeSpace 2, and they lack equivalents to the visceral beam weapons and flak cannons of the ships in the latter game.  StarLancer also offers a number of multiplayer features including, most notably, the opportunity to play through the main campaign cooperatively. Only the X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter expansion Balance of Power previously offered a significant multiplayer campaign to space-sim players, and the gameplay is considerably smoother in StarLancer. Unfortunately, the multiplayer chat dialogue line only lets you type in short sentences, and if you choose to play as a pilot you've created for the single-player game, you'll get mission statistics that are confusingly combined with your single-player results. Pilots keep all of their achievements when starting a new game in either single- or multiplayer, which gives you the advantage of accessing the more powerful fighters in the game prematurely. There is also a handful of competitive multiplayer games, several of which can be played in teams. The competitive multiplayer games include ship power-ups, and they generally emphasize gameplay commonly found in first-person-perspective shooters.  There are no stand-alone missions (in either single- or multiplayer) and there's no way to replay missions you've already completed unless you choose to revert to a game you've manually saved. Some of the game's story elements outside of the missions are tedious, such as walking around your spaceship and watching the newscasts, and the flight models and pilot artificial intelligence aren't up to the genre's standards. But the scripting and story elements within the missions, combined with the immersive graphics and sound effects, still make the campaign engaging. Because of its origin, it's not surprising that StarLancer's strength is its story-driven campaign. While it's a shame that the developers did not fix all the weaknesses that were also found in prior games such as Privateer 2, StarLancer definitely matches, and in several ways improves on, the strengths of those games. --By Desslock --Copyright ©2000 GameSpot Inc.
