## 🚀 Next Steps to Go Live

### Step 1: Create Resend Account

1. Go to **https://resend.com/signup**
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your email address
4. You'll get **3,000 free emails/month** on the free tier

### Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Go to **https://resend.com/api-keys**
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name it: `BIFL Production`
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_...`)

### Step 3: Update Local Environment

1. Open `/Users/stephen/Documents/GitHub/bifl-New/.env.local`
2. Replace this line:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key-here
   ```
   With your actual API key:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here
   ```

### Step 4: Test Locally

1. Start your dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Go to http://localhost:3000/auth/signup

3. Create a test account with your email

4. Check your inbox - you should receive a verification email

5. Click the verification link

6. You should be redirected and logged in ✅

### Step 5: Add Your Domain to Resend (Production Only)

**For production emails from your own domain:**

1. Go to **https://resend.com/domains**
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `buyitforlifeproducts.com`
4. Resend will give you DNS records to add:
   - **TXT record** for domain verification
   - **MX records** (2) for receiving bounces
   - **DKIM records** for email authentication

5. Add these to your DNS (same place you added Google Search Console TXT record)

6. Wait for verification (usually 5-15 minutes)

### Step 6: Update Email "From" Address

Once your domain is verified in Resend:

1. Open `/lib/auth.ts` (line 46)
2. Change this:
   ```typescript
   from: 'Buy It For Life <noreply@buyitforlifeproducts.com>',
   ```
   To a verified address like:
   ```typescript
   from: 'Buy It For Life <hello@buyitforlifeproducts.com>',
   ```

**Note:** Until your domain is verified, Resend will send from their default domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`), which is fine for testing but not ideal for production.

### Step 7: Deploy to Production

1. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Vercel:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/stephens-projects-xxxxxxxx/bifl-new
   - Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add new variable:
     - **Name:** `RESEND_API_KEY`
     - **Value:** Your Resend API key
     - **Environments:** Production, Preview, Development

2. Redeploy your site:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add email verification with Resend"
   git push
   ```

3. Vercel will auto-deploy with the new environment variable
